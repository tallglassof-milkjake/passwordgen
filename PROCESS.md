### Password Generator Assignment ###

This assignment was very difficult for me at first

I started by attempting to build the individual pieces of the necessary code and then string them together. This didn't work so well as I feel I didn't have an understanding of the type of thinking necessary to do so.

After some frustration and a lot of reading I deleted and started over.

I watched multiple youtube videos on all things from javascript basics to random generators and started again using what I learned from those videos and the documentation on MDN. Again I had the trouble of it not working for me when it came to stringing everything together. After some more referencing I decided to start again. Again.

Third time round I got lucky. I read the right documents and watched the right video tutorials that seemed to give me the gist of it.

The method Array.prototype.push.apply I don't fully understand but I managed to implement it to the right part of the code and it only works as a whole. I get the gist of what it is doing but I don't think I could explain it very well to someone else. I am working on using it in other code and in different ways to play with the outcomes as I learn best that way.

I wanted to implement an alert to stop the function if the user doesn't select any criteria but I had no luck here either not being able to place the code in the right place or adjust the working code to include it without breaking.

Over all I feel I shouldn't have taken this long to complete this task (roughly 12 hours over 4 days) but considering my very limited experience with javascript I am excited that I managed to get it working in the end and am looking forward to playing with it and getting in as much experience as I can.
