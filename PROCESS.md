### Password Generator Assignment ###

This assignment was very difficult for me at first

I started by attempting to build the individual pieces of the necessary code and then string them together. This didn't work so well as I feel I didn't have an understanding of the type of thinking necessary to do so and I was't sure how to connect my confirms of users criteria to the loop to generate password at random.

After some frustration and a lot of reading I deleted and started over.

I watched multiple youtube videos on all things from javascript basics to random generators and started again using what I learned from those videos and the documentation on MDN. Again I had the trouble of it not working for me when it came to stringing everything together. After some more referencing I decided to start again. Again.

Third time round I got lucky. I read the right documents and watched the right video tutorials that seemed to give me the gist of it.

The method Array.prototype.push.apply I didn't fully understand but I managed to implement it to the right part of the code and it took a long time of going through array methods to find the correct way for this task. I get the gist of what it is doing but I don't think I could explain it very well to someone else. I am working on using it in other code and in different ways to play with the outcomes as I learn best that way. I am actually attempting to create a random wordsearch generator to better myself in this area.

I wanted to implement an alert to stop the function if the user doesn't select any criteria but I had no luck here either not being able to place the code in the right place or adjust the working code to include it without breaking. Instead it all comes out as a long list of undefined if no criteria detected.

Over all I feel I shouldn't have taken this long to complete this task (roughly 12 hours over 4 days) but considering my very limited experience with javascript I am very excited that I managed to get it working in the end and am looking forward to playing with it and getting in as much experience as I can.
